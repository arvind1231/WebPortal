Growing old is a process which happens naturally. And, no one is in a position to prevent or slow it down. But, spending a happy retirement depends entirely on how you view ageing and how well you are prepared for the same. The market offers numerous options for you if you are someone exploring your choices in the field. The best option available among them at present is a retirement home.

Deciding to be an inmate of any of the luxurious old age homes in India is a great idea.
<br><br>
1. Facilities to improve social interaction:<br><br>

Loneliness, generally described as a “bitter sense of desolation or emptiness at heart” is believed to be the villain leading to numerous health reasons. All those who run retirement homes in India know this fact fully well. It implies that if you decide to be a resident of any of the old age homes in India, this situation would be taken care of. Most of the reputed institutions in the field encourage occasional visits from friends and family. They would also encourage their staying with their parents for a few days. Doing this would make sure that the resident feels valued and important.</li>

<br><br>2.Security of life:<br><br>

Lack of safety is regarded as one among the main factors leading to the popularity of retirement homes in India. Crimes against the elderly always remain on the rise. The situation becomes worse if you are fortunate to have a bit of property to take care of all your expenses. This constant threat of being attacked would bid farewell for good if you decide to be an inmate of any of the old age homes in India. All the renowned institutions in the field would be having well-trained security personnel to guard the home 24-7. This, when combined with the stringent screening of visitors in place makes sure that life remains safe in the old age homes in India.

Heavenly Palace, a great option worth considering.<br><br>

<br><br>All this and numerous other facilities would definitely make Heavenly Palace your favorite choice if you are someone trying to locate a retirement home. It features a 70,000 yards building with a senior-friendly design. The 10,000 yards hall and mini auditorium help you stay active all day long. The well-maintained library and 24-7 access to the Internet helps you stay updated with the trends in the field of your choice. It also makes sure that the diets offered to the inmates are wholesome and scientific.

When combined with regular health checkups and other arrangements for your physical and mental well-being, Heavenly Palace deserves the right to be known as the best among the luxurious retirement homes in India.
<br><br>
Life expectancy is steadily increasing, but cities are no longer safe nor friendly
neighbors a certainty. Alternative housing for the aged is a practical lifestyle solution
that developers are now ready to provide.
<br><br>
The fading joint family system in India and other innumerable factors have given rise
to west-inspired phenomena of old age homes. Surprising cost of living and scanty
return on savings have almost pushed these senior citizens on roads. Such an act
has triggered the security net of the helpless, which has almost vanished in many
states in India with Kerala topping the list.
<br><br>

Elders have started walking out of their own home in search of a journey that
promises peace, joy and celebration of life with a group of people who share the
same boat of life (the wrecked one). However not may rather none of them receive
it. A growing number of financially independent senior citizens now prefer to stay in
retirement resorts instead of languishing in the quintessential old-age homes that
they feel are “overcrowded” and “unsafe”.

<br><br>
Also Insecurity, loneliness and lack of companionship — some of life’s hard-toswallow problems — become a daily reality for these elderly persons whose children either settle abroad, or in some other state, for better career opportunities. The concept of retirement resorts or complexes is gradually emerging as the most
viable option among the senior members of society who are financially independent.


They want to live with dignity and, above all, want to be secure. Townships and residential colonies exclusively for senior citizens are now coming up in the state where they can relocate and spend the sunset of their lives without bothering about paying electricity bills, cooking and getting prompt medical care. It is this combination of physical and emotional satisfaction that today’s retirement homes strive to provide. From an era where old-age homes were synonymous with charitable institutions for the indigent and orphaned elderly, we moved some years ago to the far more refined paid homes, where amenities were good and services like on-site medical check-ups and transport arrangements were provided. Now, retirement homes are set to enter a third phase of evolution.
So I have found few good Retirement Township and Old Age homes for people who can afford them. Also you can find NGO’s Associations working for the cause of Elderly.</p>
